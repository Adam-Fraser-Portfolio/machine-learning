# machine-learning
this repository contains several modest machine learning projects

1. a manually 'learning' program for linear regression      (JS)
2. an automatically learning program for linear regression  (JS)
3. a small custom made machine learning library to make project 4 less of a nightmare (Python compiled with pypy)
4. a solution to the iris dataset classification problem, the hello world of ML       (Python)
5. a solution to the iris dataset classification problem using the very popular TensorFlow library (Python)

TODO add cool readme.md stuff
